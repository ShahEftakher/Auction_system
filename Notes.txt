Q1: Is the bid reversible?
: no
Q2: When will the losing bidder retrieve his money?
: after auction has ended


The contract right now is not reusable
single purpose

Possible fix:
 - Make ended(bool) reusable
 - startAuction(address, time) function to start a new auction
    -- But with this a single auction at a time possible
    -- auction with id
    -- bid with id
    -- withdraw with id


react-countdown:

1. The <Countdown/> components renderer prop takes a component as input
2. It passes the object to the component
    {
        total: 0,
        days: 0,
        hours: 0,
        minutes: 0,
        seconds: 0,
        milliseconds: 0,
        completed: true,
        api: { ... },
        props: { ... },
        formatted: { ... }
    }
3. The component can access the api calls accordingly

To set time manually:
In the parent component:
- take the time as input
- it will effect: date={Date.now() + input} of <Countdown/>
- the time will be updated
- then we can start the time from the renderer component
- the timer will be updating in the renderer component
- The display will be on the renderer component
- When timer completed will call the callback function specfied on the onComplete prop





Now to take input:
- Want to use date picker
- also there should be a way to set the time manually(minutes, seconds, hours)
