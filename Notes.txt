Q1: Is the bid reversible?
: no
Q2: When will the losing bidder retrieve his money?
: after auction has ended


The contract right now is not reusable
single purpose

Possible fix:
 - Make ended(bool) reusable
 - startAuction(address, time) function to start a new auction
    -- But with this a single auction at a time possible
    -- auction with id
    -- bid with id
    -- withdraw with id
